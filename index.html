    <h2>The Garfield Movie</h2>
    <p>As a family movie it is entertaining, but Garfield - the movie seems to have ignored the comedy that made him everyone's favorites cat; only traces of it still remain. It's worth watching as a family movie, but for fans of the Jim Davis comic character, it's probably best left alone.</p>
